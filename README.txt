My picture is zucc.png First, the method lizardIFY makes the image more green by multiplying the green value by 1.5
The next manipulation is 2 mirrors. I use a mirror point to mirror the left side of zucc.png to the right side. Then I
mirror the top half to the bottom half. Both are done using nested loops
